<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Games Management System — Google Workspace Add-on</p>
<p style="margin-top:8px;font-size:13px">Last Updated: February 2026</p>
</div>
<div class="wrap">

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Games Management System ("the Add-on", "the Service"), a Google Workspace Marketplace add-on for Google Sheets. By installing or using the Add-on, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By installing, accessing, or using the Games Management System add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you ("User", "you") agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Add-on. If you are using the Add-on on behalf of an organization (such as a school or sports league), you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>The Games Management System is a Google Sheets add-on that provides sports management functionality, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live game scoring (basketball and additional sports as released)</li>
<li>Team and roster management</li>
<li>Tournament creation and management (round-robin and bracket formats)</li>
<li>User role management (Super Admin, Admin, Referee, Scorekeeper, Viewer)</li>
<li>PDF and Excel report generation</li>
<li>Customizable organizational branding</li>
</ul>
<p>The Add-on operates entirely within the user's own Google Spreadsheet. All data is stored in sheets within the user's Google account.</p>

<h2>3. User Accounts and Access</h2>
<p>The Add-on uses your Google account identity (email address) for authentication. No separate account creation is required. The first user to initialize the Add-on in a given spreadsheet is designated as the Super Admin for that spreadsheet. The Super Admin may grant access to additional users with various roles and permissions.</p>

<h2>4. Service Tiers and Payments</h2>

<h3>4.1 Free Tier</h3>
<p>The Add-on includes a free tier with limited functionality (limited games, teams, users, and features). No payment is required for the free tier.</p>

<h3>4.2 Paid Tiers</h3>
<p>Additional functionality is available through paid tiers (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Payments are processed through PayPal. After payment, your tier is verified automatically through the PayPal Transaction Search API or via a manual license key.</p>

<h3>4.3 Refund Policy</h3>
<p>Refund requests must be submitted within 14 days of purchase. To request a refund, contact us at the email address provided below. Refunds are issued at our discretion and processed through PayPal.</p>

<h3>4.4 License Keys</h3>
<p>License keys are non-transferable and intended for use with a single Google Spreadsheet installation. Sharing, reselling, or redistributing license keys is prohibited.</p>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree to use the Add-on only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Add-on in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations</li>
<li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract source code from the Add-on</li>
<li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent tier limitations or licensing restrictions</li>
<li>Use the Add-on to store or transmit harmful, offensive, or illegal content</li>
<li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Add-on</li>
<li>Share, resell, or sublicense your access to the Add-on</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
<p>All sports data (games, teams, players, scores, tournaments) is stored exclusively in your own Google Spreadsheet. The Add-on does not transmit your data to any external servers except:</p>
<ul>
<li>PayPal API calls for payment verification (only your email address is used for transaction matching)</li>
<li>Standard Google Apps Script services required for operation</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on data handling.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Games Management System, including all code, design, documentation, and branding, is the intellectual property of the developer. The Add-on is licensed to you, not sold. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Add-on in accordance with these Terms and your purchased tier.</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE ADD-ON WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE ADD-ON, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>The total aggregate liability of the developer for all claims arising from your use of the Add-on shall not exceed the amount you have paid for the Add-on in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

<h2>10. Data Loss</h2>
<p>Because the Add-on stores data in your Google Spreadsheet, you are responsible for maintaining backups of your data. The developer is not responsible for any data loss resulting from user error, Google Sheets service disruptions, accidental deletion, or any other cause.</p>

<h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Add-on relies on Google Workspace services (Google Sheets, Google Apps Script) and may connect to PayPal for payment processing. Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. The developer is not responsible for the availability, performance, or policies of third-party services.</p>

<h2>12. Modifications to the Service</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Add-on or any features at any time, with or without notice. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of material changes through the Add-on interface or via email where possible.</p>

<h2>13. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Add-on if you violate these Terms or engage in abusive behavior. You may stop using the Add-on at any time by uninstalling it from Google Workspace Marketplace. Upon termination, your license to use the Add-on ends, but your data remains in your Google Spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will reflect the most recent revision. Continued use of the Add-on after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Bahrain, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Bahrain.</p>

<h2>16. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
